# LMFBRL
A Multi-Decomposition Method for Compressing Larger AI Model Based on Reinforcement Learning
We  proposes a solution: Low Rank Matrix Factorization Algorithm Based On Reinforcement Learning(LMFBRL). This method selects the optimal decomposition method for each layer, determines the appropriate rank \( r \) for each decomposition method, effectively balancing the trade-off between model compression ratio and accuracy, and achieving optimal compression results.
